# Searching for a tree in connected graph

<br>

Let $T$ be a graph with $n$ vertices. Then the following statements are equivalent:
1. $T$ is a tree;
2. $T$ contains no cycles, and has $nâ€”1$ edges;
3. $T$ is connected, and has $n-1$ edges;
4. $T$ is connected, and each edge is a bridge;
5. any two vertices of $T$ are connected by exactly one path;
6. $T$ contains no cycles, but the addition of any new edge creates exactly one
cycle.

### Definition of the spanning tree

If we choose any cycle in a connected graph $G$ and remove any of its edges, the resulting graph will still remain connected. We can repeat this procedure with any of the remaining cycles until there are no cycles left in the graph. The tree created in this way is called a **spanning tree** (or a **spanning forest**) of the graph $G$.
